The Egg Came First!

Explanation
####################
Long ago there existed a species that were similar to the chicken that we currently know , these were the proto-chickens , one of these proto-chickens gave an egg which had slight genetic mutations , what came from these egg is the chicken we know. 

So did the egg came first or the chicken ?
well it has to be the egg(the one that a diffrent species layed) , because that is what gave birth to the chicken(the first of its kind).
